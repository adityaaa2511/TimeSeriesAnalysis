# TimeSeriesAnalysis
This repository contains various statistical, machine learning, deep learning and industrial models which I have implemented while learning about Time Series Analysis.  
PS: I also read a research paper(added to the repo for reference) detailing methods to convert a time series into an image namely:-1) Gramian Angular Field 2)Markov Transition Field and then train 2-D convolutions instead. Maybe I'll write the code for this the next time I feel like messing with time series!!
